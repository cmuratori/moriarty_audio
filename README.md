# Can you process this audio to sound clean?

During the spring of 2022, I conducted a lengthy interview with Professor Brian Moriarty, the creator of no less than three seminal adventure games: [Wishbringer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishbringer), [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(video_game)), and [Loom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loom_(video_game)). The interview was conducted remotely. Due to technical issues, the locally-recorded audio of Brian's microphone for the first session was lost.

Contained in this github is a wav of the recording from my side. This was not intended to be used for the final production, and in fact I assumed it could not possibly be used as such due to the bizarre clock-skipping artifacts it has. These artifacts were from the original source on Brian's side - it was sent to my machine that way. I believe this was an artifact of the OBS/Zoom interaction on his machine.

To make matters worse, since I was assuming I would not be using the audio from my side, I was recording to an MKV via OBS, which means the audio was _compressed_ as it was recorded as well. This presumably will make it _even harder_ to restore, because things that might have been obvious discontinuities that could be easily detected will instead have been "smoothed" by the compression.

Either way, this is now the only recording that remains of the first session. I would very much like to restore it to usable quality, so I can post the complete interview series with good quality audio. Not being an audio expert, I have no idea what process I would go through to try to restore this audio. But I'm hoping someone out there might.

If anyone has any advice or suggestions, please open an issue with your suggestions.

Thanks,
